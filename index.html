                            <p>I'm Shruti Oruganti, a junior at Texas A&M University, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering through the Craig and Galen Brown Engineering Honors Program. I am passionate about sustainable and secure hardware design. I am currently working as an undergraduate researcher at the AGGIES Lab. My research focus is mainly on hardware vulnerabilities in semiconductor design and supply chains. I have been part of the team that built CapMetro a real time bus tracking app for the TeamUp organization. My main contributions were database management, creation of API calls, and end-to-end testing. I have also been a Software Engineering Intern at Comet, where I redesigned user interfaces and led development initiatives to improve platform performance and engagement. In addition to these academic pursuits, I serve as Programming Lead for WIRED VEX-U Robotics, leading projects in autonomous robotics programming and STEM outreach. My long-term goal is to advance the intersection of secure, high-performance software and hardware systems, driving innovation within the semiconductor industry.</p>
