                            <p>In addition to designing autonomous tasks for robots in competitions, I was actively involved in community outreach through the WIRED VEX-U organization. One of the core pillars of VEX-U is introducing and encouraging students from diverse backgrounds to explore STEM opportunities that challenge and inspire them. Through VEX and its wonderful team members, I was able to truly live this value. I participated in several outreach events, including volunteering at Dog Days, leading ETAM help sessions for freshmen, hosting professional development workshops, and supporting community events such as elementary school science fairs. My personal favorite experience was volunteering at the engineering project showcase, where I had the amazing opportunity of helping students present the results of their hard work and learning at Texas A&M.

                            <p>At Texas A&M, I enjoyed volunteering with the Texas Science and Engineering Fair (TXSEF). Having once stood on the other side as a student eager to share my own project board, I find it really purposeful to help create those same special moments for the next generation. My involvement has primarily been with logistical subteams, where I've supported check-ins and ensured that participants feel comfortable and prepared. Moving forwards, I hope to expand my contributions by serving on the judging panel and taking a more involved role with the organization of the event.

                            <p>I am grateful to have participated in BigEvent, the flagship of A&M's tradition of service, for the past two years. During my first year, I volunteered with the VEX Robotics team, where we assisted a family with their garden. Not only was the experience enjoyable and rewarding, but I also learned useful techniques that I later applied at home with great success. In my second year, I volunteered with Engineering Honors, where we helped renovate a patio and repaint walls. Both experiences remain especially meaningful to me, as they allowed me to connect with Bryan residents and make a small but positive difference in their lives.

                    <p>In the future, I hope to continue giving back to the community through organizations such as Women Helping Out Other People (WHOOP) and Engineers Without Borders. I strongly resonate with the missions of both groups and would be honored to contribute to organizations with such a rich history of service.</p>
